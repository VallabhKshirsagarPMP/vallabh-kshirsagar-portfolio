    <!-- ABOUT / SUMMARY -->
    <h3>Professional Summary</h3>
    <p>
      I view my career as a journey across two worlds — the structured discipline
      of project delivery and the adaptive, value-driven mindset of modern ways
      of working. Over the years, I’ve found balance between both, helping teams
      deliver complex initiatives with clarity, collaboration, and a strong focus
      on outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      I began my career deeply involved in execution, where I learned the importance
      of planning, stakeholder alignment, and predictable delivery. As I grew, I
      became increasingly curious about how teams work — why some projects flow
      smoothly while others struggle despite good intent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, I bring a blend of structured project management discipline and flexible
      delivery practices to lead initiatives that are practical, collaborative,
      and outcome-oriented.
